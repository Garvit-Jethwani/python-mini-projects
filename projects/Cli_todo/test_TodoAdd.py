Scenario 1: Test adding a task to the list in context
Details:
  TestName: test_add_task_to_context
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the task is added to the context list correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the context object with an empty 'TASKS' list and 'LATEST' set to 0.
  Act: Invoke the add function with the context object and a task string.
  Assert: Check if the task is added to the 'TASKS' list in the context with the correct ID.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the add function is correctly adding tasks to the context. The expected result of a task being added to the context meets the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Test if the task is echoed correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_task_echo
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the task is echoed with the correct string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the context object with an empty 'TASKS' list and 'LATEST' set to 0.
  Act: Invoke the add function with the context object and a task string.
  Assert: Check if the echoed string is correct.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the add function is correctly echoing the added task. The expected result of the correct echoed string meets the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Test if the task is written to the todo.txt file correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_task_written_to_file
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the task is written to the todo.txt file correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the context object with an empty 'TASKS' list and 'LATEST' set to 0. Ensure todo.txt file is empty.
  Act: Invoke the add function with the context object and a task string.
  Assert: Check if the task is written to the todo.txt file correctly, with the correct format and ID.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the add function is correctly writing tasks to the todo.txt file. The expected result of the task being written to the file with the correct format and ID meets the function's specifications and business requirements. 

Scenario 4: Test if the 'LATEST' counter is incremented correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_latest_counter_increment
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the 'LATEST' counter in the context object is incremented correctly when a task is added.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the context object with an empty 'TASKS' list and 'LATEST' set to 0.
  Act: Invoke the add function with the context object and a task string.
  Assert: Check if the 'LATEST' counter in the context object is incremented correctly.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the add function is correctly incrementing the 'LATEST' counter in the context object when a task is added. The expected result of the 'LATEST' counter being incremented correctly meets the function's specifications and business requirements. 

Scenario 5: Test adding a task when the 'add_task' parameter is None or an empty string
Details:
  TestName: test_add_empty_task
  Description: This test is intended to verify that nothing happens when the 'add_task' parameter is None or an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the context object with an empty 'TASKS' list and 'LATEST' set to 0.
  Act: Invoke the add function with the context object and 'add_task' as None or an empty string.
  Assert: Check if the 'TASKS' list and 'LATEST' counter in the context object remain unchanged.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the add function handles the case where 'add_task' is None or an empty string correctly. The expected result of the 'TASKS' list and 'LATEST' counter remaining unchanged meets the function's specifications and business requirements.
