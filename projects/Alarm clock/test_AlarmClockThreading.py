Scenario 1: Validating the successful creation and start of a new thread
Details:
  TestName: test_threading_start
  Description: This test is intended to verify if a new thread is successfully created and started when the function Threading() is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Thread class and its start method to check if they're called correctly.
  Act: Invoke the function Threading without any parameters.
  Assert: Check if the Thread class was instantiated with the correct parameters and if the start method was called on the thread instance.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of the test, it ensures that the function Threading() is correctly creating and starting a new thread as per its specification. This is crucial as threads are the fundamental units of execution in any application, and improper handling can lead to unexpected application behavior.

Scenario 2: Validating the target function of the thread
Details:
  TestName: test_threading_target_function
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the target function of the new thread is correctly set to 'alarm'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Thread class to inspect the parameters passed when it's instantiated.
  Act: Invoke the function Threading without any parameters.
  Assert: Check if the 'target' parameter of the Thread class was set to 'alarm'.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function Threading() is setting the target function of the thread to 'alarm' as per its specification. This is critical as the target function defines what task the new thread will perform.

Scenario 3: Validating the non-blocking nature of the function
Details:
  TestName: test_threading_non_blocking
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function Threading() is non-blocking, i.e., it returns immediately after starting the new thread without waiting for the thread to finish execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Thread class and its start method. Record the time before and after the function Threading() is called.
  Act: Invoke the function Threading without any parameters.
  Assert: Check if the time difference between the time before and after the function call is negligible.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function Threading() is non-blocking as per its specification. This is essential as it allows the main thread of the application to continue execution without being halted, thus improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.
