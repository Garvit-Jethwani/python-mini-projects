```
Scenario 1: Verify that a new thread is created and started when calling the Threading method
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_creation_start
  Description: This test ensures that a new thread is run when the method Threading is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Thread class in the threading module to monitor the creation and starting of new threads.
  Act: Call the Threading method.
  Assert: Assert that Thread() was called once and start() was invoked once in the resulting thread object.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: Ensuring that a new thread is being run, and started properly is one of the core parts of the Threading function. If the thread is not started as expected, the effect of asynchronous behaviour, which may be critical to the system, will be lost.

Scenario 2: Ensure that the function passed to the Thread’s target is the alarm function.
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_target
  Description: This test aims to verify if the target of the thread is the alarm function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Thread class in the threading module to check the arguments that it is initialized with.
  Act: Call the Threading method.
  Assert: Assert that the 'target' parameter passed to Thread is the alarm function.
Validation: 
  Ensuring that the proper function is set as the target of the thread is essential to ensure the success of the Threading function. The alarm function must be the one that is processed in the new thread.

Scenario 3: Test the program’s behaviour if the alarm function raises an exception.
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_exception_handling
  Description: The test verifies that the program behaves as expected if the alarm function raised an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the alarm function and configure it to raise an exception.
  Act: Call the Threading method.
  Assert: Check the application behavior when the alarm function raises an exception.
Validation:
  It’s important to handle exceptions properly, because if not handled, it might lead to the System becoming unresponsive or stop working altogether.
