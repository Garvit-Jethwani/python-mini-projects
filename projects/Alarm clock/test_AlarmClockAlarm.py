Scenario 1: Validate alarm sound for correct alarm time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_sound_for_correct_time
  Description: This test verifies that the alarm sounds when the actual time equals the alarm time that is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the alarm for a certain time in the future and prepare a mechanism to record the system sound.
  Act: Start the application and allow it to run until the set time.
  Assert: Check whether the expected sound file ("sound.wav") is played at the set time.
Validation:
  This test is fundamental to verify whether the alarm clock function works as expected since the alarm should sound at the set time.

Scenario 2: Validate the alarm during different hours of the day
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_at_different_hours
  Description: A series of tests that verify whether the alarm works correctly during different times of the day, including the transition from PM to AM and vice versa.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the alarm for different hours of the day and prepare a mechanism to record the system sound.
  Act: Start the application and allow it to run until the set times.
  Assert: Check whether the alarm occurs correctly at the set times.
Validation:
  This set of tests ensures that the application works correctly at any time of the day, including the transitions from PM to AM and vice versa. 

Scenario 3: Validate the alarm during system sleep 
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_when_system_sleep
  Description: This test verifies that the alarm can wake up a sleeping system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the alarm for a certain time and then put the system into sleep mode.
  Act: Allow the system to remain in sleep mode until the alarm time.
  Assert: Check whether the system wakes up and the alarm sounds at the set time.
Validation:
  This test is vital to check whether the alarm function can wake up the system from sleep mode. Considering the nature of the application, this feature is crucial as the system might be in sleep mode when the alarm is set to go off.

Scenario 4: Validate alarm after system reboot
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_after_reboot
  Description: This test verifies that the alarm persists after a system reboot.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the alarm for a certain time, then reboot the system.
  Act: Start the application after the reboot and allow it to run until the alarm time.
  Assert: Check whether the alarm sounds at the set time.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify if application can handle system reboots and still function as expected. If the alarm cannot persist through a reboot, then it is a significant drawback to the applicationâ€™s usability.
