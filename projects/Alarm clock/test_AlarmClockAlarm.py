ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=alarm_6edf31f1cc

Scenario 1: Alarm set for a future time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_set_future_time
  Description: This test verifies that the alarm function correctly waits until the set alarm time and then plays the sound.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the hour, minute, and second variables to a time that is a few seconds in the future.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function.
  Assert: Check that the sound is played at the set alarm time.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the alarm function is working properly. The expected result is that the alarm sound is played at the correct time, which is a key requirement of the function.

Scenario 2: Alarm set for the current time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_set_current_time
  Description: This test verifies that the alarm function plays the sound immediately if the set alarm time is the current time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the hour, minute, and second variables to the current time.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function.
  Assert: Check that the sound is played immediately.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the alarm function reacts correctly when the set alarm time is the current time. The expected result is that the alarm sound is played immediately, which meets the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Alarm set for a past time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_set_past_time
  Description: This test verifies that the alarm function does not play the sound if the set alarm time is in the past.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the hour, minute, and second variables to a time that is a few seconds in the past.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function.
  Assert: Check that the sound is not played.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the alarm function does not play the sound for a time that has already passed. The expected result is that the alarm sound is not played, which meets the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Alarm set for an invalid time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_set_invalid_time
  Description: This test verifies that the alarm function handles invalid time input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the hour, minute, and second variables to an invalid time (e.g., 25:61:61).
  Act: Invoke the alarm function.
  Assert: Check that the function does not crash and does not play the sound.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the alarm function is robust and can handle invalid input. The expected result is that the function does not crash and does not play the sound, which meets the function's specifications.
